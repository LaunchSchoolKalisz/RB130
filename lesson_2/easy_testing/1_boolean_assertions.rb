assert value.odd?, 'value is not odd'

Discussion
#assert tests whether its first argument is truthy (that is, it is neither false nor nil). If the first 
argument is not truthy, the test fails, and the second argument is displayed as the failure message.

Most (but not all) of the minitest assertions let you specify a failure message as the final argument. This 
is frequently omitted since the error messages provided by default are usually sufficient. However, the 
default message for assert lacks context, so it is common to specify the failure message when using assert.

assert isn't used directly in most tests since it is usually more important to ensure an exact value is 
returned; if you want to know that your method returns true and not just a truthy value, assert_equal is a 
better choice. For example:

assert_equal true, value.odd?
=end
